* Created skeleton for JUnit testing class.
* Completed constructors for NumArrayList class.
* Created method to double the current array's capacity in case there isn't sufficient room to add.
  * This caused some issues with arrays with a length of 0 and can cause issues later with larger arrays in terms of efficiency so I will rewrite this.
* Wrote the methods that return the size and capacity of the arrays.&#x20;
* Worked on the add method but ran into issues with the helper method I mentioned above.

Time spent: \~50min
